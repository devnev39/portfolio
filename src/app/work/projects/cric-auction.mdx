## Overview
Cric Auction is a platform designed to simulate cricket player auctions. It is currently used annually by a few colleges in the Pune region of Maharashtra, India.
This is the third revision of this platform. It offers many features, including player and team data management, team evaluation based on provided metrics, security through a simple authentication system, and real-time updates with MQTT service, among others.

## Key Features

- Auction authentication with session management
- Custom players dataset and default dataset option
- Stats display for the teams
- Realtime updates for all the auction screens
- Automatic metric evaluation based on provided rules

## Technologies Used

- **React Redux**: For building the front-end with clean, reusable components with robust state management with redux.
- **Vercel**: To deploy the frontend fast and efficiently.
- **Express.js**: To build the backend service.
- **Docker**: To manager and dockerize the project to be hosted on GCP.
- **GCP**: To host the backend service. GCP with a free tier cloud run has less time in cold start that any other free service.
- **MQTT**: To publish and subscribe to MQTT topics for realtime updates.

## Challenges and Learnings

> While building the first version of this project, I had to conduct extensive research on database modeling, as I was in my second year of engineering. Every time I thought about the database structure, I felt overwhelmed. However, after several iterations, I realized there is no perfect way to get things right the first time. The key is to implement a solution that works, as long as it efficiently utilizes resources.

> One major challenge I faced was with Socket.io—connections kept dropping randomly, and I couldn't figure out why. While deploying the backend on a GCP Compute Engine (VM) resolved the issue, I hesitated due to concerns about cost. Fortunately, I discovered MQTT during an internship project, which turned out to be a reliable solution. Since it worked well, I decided to stick with it and didn’t make further changes to that part of the system.

> When deploying the frontend and backend on free-tier services like Render, one challenge I encountered was session management, as Render doesn’t provide site certificates. Switching to Vercel for the frontend and GCP for the backend resolved all these issues.

## Outcome

This project was a valuable learning experience. It is now actively used by several colleges in the Pune region to host similar events. Throughout the extended development process, driven by user feedback, I gained significant insights into the software development life cycle (SDLC). What began as a simple exercise evolved into a cornerstone project that shaped my approach to software development.
